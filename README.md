Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ I'm thrilled to share that I've just completed a fun project building a calculator app using React Native. ðŸŽ‰

As part of my practice and to explore the capabilities of React Native, I decided to create a simple yet functional calculator with the four basic operations: addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.

Not only did I achieve the core functionality of performing calculations accurately, but I also went a step further and added a unique and trendy feature - a Dark Mode Toggle! ðŸŒ™

The calculator app provides a sleek and user-friendly interface that enables users to perform calculations seamlessly. It supports the basic arithmetic operations and ensures precise and accurate results.

One of the highlights of this project is the integration of Dark Mode Toggle. By adding this feature, users can switch between light and dark themes based on their preference or to suit different lighting conditions. The Dark Mode Toggle enhances the overall user experience and makes it visually appealing.

ðŸ“¸ Here are a few snapshots of the calculator app:

I've thoroughly enjoyed working on this project as it allowed me to strengthen my skills in React Native and develop a practical and functional application.
